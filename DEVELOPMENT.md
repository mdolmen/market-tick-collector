# Development log

Per-phase predictions and the measurements that grade them. Design decisions and their
rationale live in `NOTES.md`; the sequenced task list is `TODO.md`. The rule this file
exists to enforce: **the prediction is written down before the run**, and a wrong prediction
stays on the page.

## Phase 0 — walking skeleton

One Binance symbol, full-depth diffs, bootstrapped over the splice, applied into a book,
emitted as normalized level rows, landed as a Parquet dataset, for a bounded duration.

### The prediction

Written **before** the measured runs. What had already been seen when this was written, in
the interest of not overclaiming: a five-second smoke run against a console sink reported an
in-process p50 around 170µs per frame. Nothing else had been measured, and no decoder
comparison had been run at all.

**Decode is not the hotspot.** `NOTES.md` § *Technical notes* says JSON decode "may well
dominate the profile" on a high-rate diff stream. The prediction is that it does not, at this
frame shape: a 100ms Binance diff carries only a handful of price levels, and the per-level
work *after* the decoder returns — two `Decimal` constructions and a `scaleb` each, to reach
the integer book key — costs several times the parse of the whole frame. Concretely:

- `msgspec` typed decodes fastest, `orjson` within ~30% of it, stdlib `json` 3–5× slower
- On decode **+ model** the three converge to within ~30% of each other, because `Decimal`
  dominates and every decoder pays it identically
- So the Phase 9 hotspot is price/size normalization, not JSON, and the fix is to stop going
  through `Decimal` in the hot path rather than to swap decoder

If that is wrong, the interesting version of wrong is that real frames are much wider than
the smoke run suggested — in which case the decoder ranking survives and the per-frame level
count is the number that actually mattered.

**Throughput here proves nothing, and that is fine.** One symbol on a 100ms channel is ~10
frames/s, bounded entirely by the venue rather than by this code. The Phase 0 number is a
floor and a regression tripwire, not a claim. Expect the Phase 1 replay ceiling three or four
orders of magnitude above it, and never report the two as one number.

**Architecture predictions, for Phase 9 to grade:**

- The `dict` book holds up on writes under every load this project reaches. What breaks first
  is `best_bid_ask` — an O(n) scan — and it breaks in Phase 8, when the top-N oracle starts
  reading it continuously, not before. The read:write ratio picks the structure.
- Reader thread + ring buffer beats pure asyncio by **less than 2×**, and most of that margin
  comes from getting decode off the reader thread rather than from the threading itself.
- `Record = dict[str, Any]` becomes the dominant per-row cost somewhere around 10⁵ rows/s,
  which is what forces the Arrow-batch `Sink` — the SemVer-major change in `NOTES.md`
  § *The SDK gaps*.
